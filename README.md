# Configs
Configuration files for the programming tools I use.
Useful for a quick start when developing on a new machine.

## Installation
Clone the repository and run the installation script:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/pbetkier/configs
$ cd configs/
$ ./install.sh
```

This creates symlinks to configuration files kept in ``configs/files`` directory.
A copy of previous configuration is saved to ``*.old`` file.

## Packages
Packages from ``packages`` have to be installed manually via apt or brew.
